# Zoo-Management-System
A Zoo Management System built in Python demonstrating OOP concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, abstract classes, and operator overloading. Includes simulation of animals, employees, and enclosures.


ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project is a Zoo Management System implemented in Python, designed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) assignment.
The system models real-world zoo operations such as animal management, employee tasks, and enclosure handling while applying core OOP principles.

The project demonstrates:
	â€¢	Inheritance (single, multilevel, hierarchical, multiple)
	â€¢	Encapsulation (private attributes, property decorators)
	â€¢	Polymorphism (method overriding, duck typing)
	â€¢	Abstract Base Classes (ABC)
	â€¢	Special methods like _str, __add, and __iter_
	â€¢	Class & static methods

ðŸŽ¯ Features

Phase 1: Core Implementation
	â€¢	Animal hierarchy with 5+ subclasses (Lion, Penguin, Snake, etc.)
	â€¢	Encapsulation with protected/private attributes (health, age)
	â€¢	Employee subclasses: Veterinarian & Zookeeper with role-specific methods
	â€¢	Enclosure class with operator overloading (_add, __len_)

Phase 2: Advanced Features
	â€¢	Multiple inheritance with HybridAnimal (e.g., FlyingFish)
	â€¢	Abstract base class Animal enforcing make_sound()
	â€¢	Class methods for handling animal births (from_birth())
	â€¢	Duck-typed feed() function compatible with all animals

Phase 3: Simulation
	â€¢	Zoo with 3+ enclosures
	â€¢	10+ animals of different types
	â€¢	Employees perform tasks:
	â€¢	Veterinarians treat sick animals
	â€¢	Zookeepers move animals between enclosures
	â€¢	Daily simulation where animals:
	â€¢	Age and lose health
	â€¢	Employees perform duties
	â€¢	Zoo status tracked using _str_

ðŸ›  Technologies Used

ðŸ“¸ Example Output

Day 1 Simulation:
- Lion makes a roar sound
- Penguin makes a squawk sound
- Veterinarian treated a sick Snake
- Zookeeper moved Penguin to Enclosure 2
Zoo has 3 enclosures and 12 animals

ðŸ“š OOP Concepts Demonstrated
	â€¢	Inheritance: Animal â†’ Mammal â†’ Lion
	â€¢	Encapsulation: __health, __age with property setters/getters
	â€¢	Polymorphism: make_sound() overridden in subclasses
	â€¢	Multiple Inheritance: FlyingFish â†’ Fish, Bird
	â€¢	Abstract Class: Animal with @abstractmethod make_sound()
	â€¢	Special Methods: _str, __add, __iter_
